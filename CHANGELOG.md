## February 3, 2026
- **New Feature: Delete Note:** Added ability to delete specific notes using their ID.
- **New Feature: Clear Screen:** Added `clear` command to clean the terminal window.
- **UX Improvement:** The main menu now runs in a loop (REPL), allowing multiple actions without restarting the program.

## January 30, 2026

## January 29, 2026
- **CI Integration:** Add a simple CI for Rust taken from GitHub actions template/suggested workflows.

## January 18, 2026
- **Note Display:** Notes are now parsed and formatted. Timestamps are visually separated from the message content using a dimmed style for better focus on the text.

## January 17, 2026
- **Architecture Change:** Removed single-line argument mode to focus entirely on the interactive menu experience.
- **Refactoring:**
    - Cleaned up `main` function by removing `env::args` logic.
    - Simplified path handling and imports.
    - Extracted core note management functions (`take_note`, `read_note`, `save_note`) into a new `notes.rs` module for better separation of concerns.

## January 16, 2026
- **New Feature: View Notes:** Added a "list" command to view existing notes directly from the CLI.
- **Interactive Menu:** Introduced a new main menu to choose between adding new notes (`add`) or listing existing ones (`list`).

## January 15, 2026
- **Refactoring:**
    - Extracted core logic into a dedicated `take_note` function to separate initialization from execution.
    - Simplified `main` function to handle only configuration steps.
- **Improvement:**
    - `save_note` now respects user-provided file extensions, only appending `.txt` if no extension is present.

## January 14, 2026
- **New Feature: Custom Save Paths:**
    - Users can now specify a custom file path for saving notes (defaults to `notes.txt`).
    - Added prompt for save location on startup.
- **Code Review & Documentation:**
    - Added TODO comments throughout the codebase identifying areas for future improvements.
    - Improved note format from "message, Created at: timestamp" to "message [timestamp]" for better readability.

## January 13, 2026
- **Code Refactoring:**
    - Refactored input validation to use Rust pattern matching (`match`) instead of nested if-else statements for cleaner, more idiomatic code.
    - Moved `save_note` function outside of `main` to improve code organization and modularity.
- **Code Quality:** Improved code readability and maintainability following Rust best practices.

## January 12, 2026
- **Added Interactive Mode:** The program now enters a live input loop if no command-line arguments are provided.
- **Improved CLI Arguments:** Used argument joining to allow multi-word notes without needing quotation marks.
- **Enhanced Time Accuracy:** Switched from UTC to Local timezone for more relevant note timestamps.
- **Input Validation:** Added logic to ignore empty entries and prevent cluttered log files.
- **Interactive UI Improvements:**
    - Added a persistent `>` blue prompt for better user feedback.
    - Added a `quit` command to exit the interactive session.
- **Styling:**
    - Added colored output using the `colored` library.
